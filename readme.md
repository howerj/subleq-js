This project contains an interactive 16-bit SUBLEQ interpreter that
should run in your web-browser, and by default it should run an eForth
interpreter.

If you feel like supporting the project you can buy a book from
Amazon, available [here](https://www.amazon.com/SUBLEQ-EFORTH-Forth-Metacompilation-Machine-ebook/dp/B0B5VZWXPL)
that describes how the project works and how to port a Forth to
a new platform.
